The code in this folder generates all the risk and resilience measures, as well as all the tables and figures present in the paper:

The code was provided by Fabrizio Colella and Rafael Lalive. 


# Description of the folders

- `input` 				contains all the input files (either publicly available or created by the authors)
		
- `do` 					contains all the code


# Description of the folders generated by the code

- `dta`					is an empty folder that will contain the generated datasets

- `output`				is an empty folder that will contain the output tables

- `output/figures_tables_in_the_paper` 	is an empty folder that will contain the figures and the tables in the paper


# How to use

**Note:** In order to run the following file you will need to use the [Stata](https://www.stata.com/) (a software for statistics and data science)

- open the file `do/0_project_folder.do`

- in the file `do/0_project_folder.do` change the hardcoded directory after `global project` to the full path corresponding to the root folder of this project. i.e. select the path to the directory `jobrisk`

- save the file `do/0_project_folder.do`

- open the file `do/00_run_all.do`

- run it (in Stata) to get all the data/figures/tables related to the paper

The code will populate the folders with the files as above. The folder "output/figures_tables_in_the_paper" 
will contain all the figures in the tables and the figures in the paper, generated following the same order in which
they appear in the paper. All the figures and tables starting for "S" referes to results in the supplementary material.
The tables S1 and S2 are not generated by this code as they are the result of an ex-ante computation of the authors.
